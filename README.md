# Merdeka Internal

We are working on internal version, might be took a long work and this will be hooking into CoreGui but its detected. We cant implemented Algorithm since internal used Lua and Python. dont worry there is a way.

## Executor

Merdeka Internal has basic sleek or clean UI. There is a change getting undetected. the injector we using is Python, and we need to find Offset or use offset dumper to do it

## Injector

The injector is easy to make on C++. One problem we need to implemented Algorithm so to make it undetectable

## API

The API we gonna using is ForlornApi. There is a way we need to use autoexec files to get internal ui just like syn z

## are we legit

Yes. We are legit

## Open Sourced

This will be open sourced code. its completedly free to use. if you skid my ui type shit. lol skidder
